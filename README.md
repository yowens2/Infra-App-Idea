### **The Benefit of using Map Data, to Enahnce SAP Data**

ðŸ’¦With the use of Python on the boom being adopted, in the Analaytics Acadmey, Telling Stories through Data is even more important to insure, that the data we provide is relatable and beliavble. 

By using Python (Geemaps) you are able to leverage the analytical capability of map data, stored in various formats, sh, json, geojson to list a few.

This is my journey in understanding geo spatial data, and linking it to our Asset Base, by using various analytical techniques. To give a user a visual representation of the region we serve enviromental and social prosperity.
