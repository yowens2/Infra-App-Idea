Fun personal projects for learning Geo Spatial And Asset Managment Principles

<img width="298" alt="import GEO - EDA Packages" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98616502/171999978-fcd0c263-9dc4-479e-88b6-529e4e32b49f.png">

with a few lines of code you can start to create a canvas for analysis 

Using python we can use GeoPandas to do analaysis on Map Data in variouse differnent formats, GeoJson, Json, Link to Google Map Api

and Voila!


###### using a combination of Layers

# Playing with popular tools.
###### GIS, LIDAR etc

I used Various Tools, to outline various pieces of equipment, and used a tool to find the area of the site and also the distance between to processes, i have started looking at water flow and layering this on top of this data. (stay tuned)
